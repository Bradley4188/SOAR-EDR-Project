# Detection Lab  

## Objective  
The Detection Lab project aims to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary goal is to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience is designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.  

## Skills Learned  
- Developing a deeper understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.  
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs to identify attack patterns.  
- Strengthening knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.  
- Recognizing and generating attack signatures to improve detection accuracy.  
- Enhancing critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.  
- Configuring and optimizing SIEM tools for threat detection and response.  

## Tools Used  
- **SIEM Tools** – Azure Sentinel and Splunk for log ingestion and analysis.  
- **Network Analysis Tools** – Wireshark for capturing and examining network traffic.  
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** – LimaCharlie for real-time endpoint protection and monitoring.  
- **Telemetry Generation Tools** – For creating realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.  
- **Security Automation** – Shuffle (SOAR) for automating response actions and improving efficiency.  

## Progress Overview  
The project is ongoing, with a current focus on:  
- Fine-tuning log analysis and correlation rules within Azure Sentinel and Splunk.  
- Expanding attack simulations to cover a wider range of network-based threats.  
- Integrating LimaCharlie with SIEM tools for real-time endpoint threat detection.  
- Automating response workflows using Shuffle to improve incident response time.
